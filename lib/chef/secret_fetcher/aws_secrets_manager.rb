class Chef
  # == Chef::SecretFetcher::AWSSecretsManager
  # A fetcher that fetches a secret from AWS Secrets Manager
  # In this initial iteration it defaults to authentication via instance profile.
  # It is possible to pass options that configure it to use alternative credentials.
  #
  # For configuration options see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/SecretsManager/Client.html#initialize-instance_method
  #
  # Note that ~/.aws default and environment-based configurations are supported by default in the
  # ruby SDK.
  #
  # Usage Example:
  #
  # fetcher = SecretFetcher.for_service(:aws_secrets_manager, { region: "us-east-1" })
  # fetcher.fetch("secretkey1")

        # Note that we are not doing any validation of required configuration here, we will
        # rely on the API client to do that for us, since it will work with the merge of
        # the config we provide, env-based config, and/or an appropriate profile in ~/.aws

        # Instantiating the client is an opportunity for an API provider to do validation,
        # so we'll do that first here.
